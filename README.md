# Algorand Daily Lottery - Verification Tools

**Provably Fair Lottery Verification System**

Don't trust, verify! This repository contains everything you need to independently verify that our Algorand-based daily lottery is fair and transparent.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Download the verification script
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/algodailylottery/algo-daily-lottery-verification-public/main/verify_draw.py

# Install requirements
pip install requests

# Verify any cycle
python3 verify_draw.py 7
```

## What Gets Verified

- **Tier 1 Winner** (40% of pot) - Exact entry match
- **Tier 2 Winners** (20% of pot) - All 5 winning entries
- **Tier 3 Winners** (15% of pot) - All 10 winning entries

## How It Works

### 1. On-Chain Seed Generation (VRF Beacon)
The smart contract uses **Algorand's official Randomness Beacon** for cryptographically secure randomness:
- Commit-reveal pattern prevents manipulation
- VRF (Verifiable Random Function) provides unpredictable output
- 32-byte seed retrieved from beacon after commitment

This seed is logged on the Algorand blockchain and **cannot be changed**.

### 2. Deterministic Winner Selection
Using the blockchain seed, winners are selected with Java's Random algorithm.

**Key principle**: Same seed = Same winners (always)

This makes any manipulation immediately detectable.

### 3. Independent Verification
Anyone can:
1. Get the seed from blockchain
2. Run the same algorithm
3. Compare results with registered winners

If they match ✅ = Fair
If they don't ❌ = Suspicious

## Tools Included

### 🔧 `verify_draw.py`
Main verification script - compares calculated winners with registered winners.

**Usage:**
```bash
python3 verify_draw.py <cycle_number>
```

**Example:**
```bash
python3 verify_draw.py 7
```

### 🔗 `get_seed_from_blockchain.py`
Retrieves the random seed directly from Algorand blockchain (no API needed).

**Usage:**
```bash
python3 get_seed_from_blockchain.py 7
```

### 🧪 `test_determinism.py`
Demonstrates that the same seed always produces identical results.

**Usage:**
```bash
python3 test_determinism.py
```

🔍 ALGORAND DAILY LOTTERY - FAIRNESS VERIFICATION

📋 Verifying Cycle 15...
✅ Draw data loaded successfully

📊 Draw Information:
   Cycle ID:      15
   Seed Type:     VRF Beacon
   Random Seed:   7f3a9b2c8d1e4f5a...6d7e8f9a0b1c2d3e
   Pot Total:     4250.00 ALGO
   Total Entries: 4125

🎲 Calculating winners from on-chain seed...

🥇 TIER 1: ✅ MATCH
🥈 TIER 2: ✅ SAME ENTRIES
🥉 TIER 3: ✅ SAME ENTRIES

✅ ✅ ✅  DRAW IS FAIR AND VALID  ✅ ✅ ✅
```

**Note:** Cycles before VRF upgrade show `Seed Type: Legacy` with numeric seeds.

## Why This Matters

**Traditional Lottery:**
```
Operator → Secret Draw → Winners
```
❌ You must trust the operator

**Our Lottery:**
```
Blockchain → Public Seed → Verifiable Winners
```
✅ No trust needed - pure math

## Security

The lottery uses:
- ✅ Algorand VRF Beacon (cryptographically secure randomness)
- ✅ Commit-reveal pattern (prevents manipulation)
- ✅ Deterministic algorithm (verifiable)
- ✅ Public blockchain logs (transparent)
- ✅ Open source tools (auditable)

**Can the admin cheat?**
No. If registered winners don't match the blockchain seed, this script will immediately detect it.

**Note on Tier 3 Winners:**
The smart contract was designed for 20 Tier 3 winners, but the implementation selects 10. We went live with 10 and decided to keep it stable rather than risk changes to the live system. The lottery is still provably fair - all prize money is distributed correctly. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md#known-issues) for full details.
